Accelerating Data Science Workflows with RAPIDS

RAPIDS is a suite of open source software libraries that gives you the ability to accelerate and execute end-to-end data science workflows entirely on GPUs. 

In this notebook we will use cuDF (DataFrame library interoperable with Pandas) and GPU accelerated XGBoost, work through a series of exercises to port and refactor CPU code onto GPU.
